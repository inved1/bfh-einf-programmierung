<pre><p>A line in the plane can be specified in various ways:
- by giving two different points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)
- by giving a point (x,y) and a slope m
- as parameters b, m of an equation of the form y = mx + b
- as an equation x = a, if the line is vertical
Implement a class Line with four constructor, corresponding to the four cases above. Then implement the following methods:
boolean isVertical()
boolean isHorizontal()
boolean equals(Line other)
boolean isParallel(Line other)
boolean intersects(Line other)
