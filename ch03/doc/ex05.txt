Write a program that read two times in military format (0900, 1730, etc) and prints the number of hours and minutes between the two times. Here is a sample run:

Please enter the first time: 0900
Please enter the second time: 1700
8 hours 30 minutes

Hint: Implement a class TimeInterval whose constructor takes two military times. The class should have two methods getHours and getMinutes.
