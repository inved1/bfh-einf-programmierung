<pre><p>Write a program which computes for two input integer values
- the sum
- the difference
- the product
- the average
- the distance (absolute value of the difference)
- the maximum
- the minimum

To do so, implement a class Pair, which stores the two value and which provides a method for each of the above computations, e.g. getSum, getDifference, etc.

Write a class PairTester for testing.</p></pre>
