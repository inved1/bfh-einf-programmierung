<pre><p>Write a class RationalNumber to represents positive rational numbers (e.g. 1/3, 9/16, etc.) precisely. The class should have at least the following public methods:

- RationalNumber add(RationalNumber x)
- RationalNumber subtract(RationalNumber x)
- RationalNumber multiply(RationalNumber x)
- RationalNumber divide(RationalNumber x)
- String toString() 
- Double toDouble() 

Provide two constructors:

RationalNumber(long value) 
RationalNumber(long nominator, long denominator) 

Hint 1: Write a private method &quot;void reduce()&quot; to reduce (kürzen) the given rational number.

Hint 2: Copy/paste the following helper method:

private static int gcd(int m, int n) {
   if (n == 0) 
      return m;
   else 
      return gcd(n, m % n);
}

Write a class RationalNumberTester for testing.</p></pre>
