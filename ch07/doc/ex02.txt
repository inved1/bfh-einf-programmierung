Start implementing your Panini simulation. Define corresponding classes for 
- the players, 
- the teams, 
- the list of teams.
Specify for each of these classes appropriate constructors and methods. If necessary, specify corresponding pre- and postconditions. Implement the classes and put them into a package "panini" (or similar). Consider implementing corresponding JUnit testing classes.
