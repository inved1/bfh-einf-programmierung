Continue implementing your Panini simulation. Define corresponding classes for 
- pictures, 
- packages,
- boxes,
- albums.
Specify for each of these classes appropriate constructors and methods. If necessary, specify corresponding pre- and postconditions. Note that the list of teams needs to be passed as argument to each of the constructors.
