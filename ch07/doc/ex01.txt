Consider implementing a simulation of the Panini football picture trading on the schoolyard. Consider the following aspects:

- There are 10 teams. Each team consists of 2 goalkeepers, 6 defenders, 6 midfielders, and 4 attackers. Each player has a number, a name, an age, and a function (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, attacker).

- The Panini picture factory produces random pictures of the players, packs them into packages of 4 pictures each, and delivers a box of 50 packages to the shop. The production of a box costs $10 and the price for a box is $25. If no boxes are available for delivering, 10 new boxes are produced.

- The shop sells the picture packages for $1 to the children. The shop orders a new new box of picture packages from the factory if no packages are left.

- Each child has a certain amount of money available to buy new pictures. At the beginning, this amount is $0. From time to time, some children receive a certain amount of pocket money.

- Each child posses an album for collecting the pictures. The album contains an area for the picture of each player.

- Children exchange duplicate pictures to fill up the album more quickly.

- The simulation selects at random some children who receive pocket money, buy packages, and exchange duplicate pictures. If the album is filled up, the child leaves the schoolyard.

Design appropriate classes to model the entities included in such a simulation. Draw an UML class diagram which shows the dependencies between the classes. What is the information to be stored in each class?
