Conclude your Panini simulation by defining corresponding classes for 
- the simulation, 
- testing the simulation.

The simulation should provide a single public method "run", which repeats the following tasks until all children have left the schoolyard:
- several children receive some pocket money
- several children buy a new picture package
- several children exchange their duplicates
After each of these tasks, the current state of the simulation should be printed (state of the factory, the shop, and schoolyard).

The simulation tester should create a list of teams, a shop, a factory, and a schoolyard with some children, and then start the simulation.
