Expand the IntegerList class discussed during the course with the following additional methods:

a) boolean contains(int x): returns true if x is included in the list, false otherwise

b) int position(int x): returns the position of x in the list (or -1 if x is not included in the list)

c) String swap(int i, int j): swaps the integers stored at positions i and j (returns an error message or a string which confirms the swapping)

d) void reverse(): reverses the order of the elements in the list

OPTIONAL
e) sort(): sorts the integer list in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm (see step-by-step example on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
