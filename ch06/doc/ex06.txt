A "magic square" is an NxN matrix that is filled with the numbers 1 to N^2 such that the sum of the values in each row, in each column, and in the two diagonals is the same value M = N(N^2+1)/2. Example: N=3, M=15
 6  7  2
 3  4  8
 9  1  5

a) Write a class MagicSquare with a constructor that works as follows (only if N is odd):
- Place a 1 in the middle of the bottom row
- After the number k has been placed in the cell at index (i,j), try to place the number k+1 into the cell to the right and down, wrapping around the borders.
- If the cell to the right an down is already occupied, place it into the cell straight up instead.
If N is even, construct a magic square for N+1.

OPTIONAL:
b) Add the following methods to the MagicSquare class:
- int magicNumber(): returns M
- boolean isMagic(): returns true if the square is magic, false otherwise
- void print(): prints the magic square
